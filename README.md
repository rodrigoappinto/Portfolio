Hello Everyone!
My name is Rodrigo Pinto, I am a AI/ML Engineer that loves to do Landscape/Human Nature photography for a hobby! üèîÔ∏è üì∑ üå≥

### In the case you would like to replicate it for your own use case, feel free to use my code!

This project was developed utilizing cutting-edge technologies for web development. For both the frontend and backend, Next.js 14 and Tailwind were employed. Supabase was additionally chosen as the main database for photo storage. The project was ultimately deployed on Vercel, ensuring a fast and handi real-time deployments when commiting to production on Github.

Given that Next.js is designed to build full-stack applications, to run the application you only need to run one of the following commands:

```bash
## For this example, I'll be using npm as my package manager. Of course, you can choose whichever tool you're most comfortable with.

## Start by installing all the dependencies
npm install

## When that is done, you can finaly launch Next.js 14
npm run dev
```


In case you also want to replicate the usage of Supabase, please create a .env.local file and add you environment variables as followed:
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```
Thank you for having a look at my portfolio it out and leave me a message in one of my socials if you enjoyed it!
